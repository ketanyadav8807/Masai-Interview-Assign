Q 5.2 => What are some patterns you follow ?

Answer =>

    1. Appropriate Naming and Destructuring Props 
        *To keep readable and clean code, use meaningful and short names for props of the component. 
        * Also, use props destructuring feature of function which discards the need to write props with each property name and can be used as it is.
    
    2. Naming Conventions 
        * A component name should always be in a Pascal case like ‚ÄòSelectButton‚Äô, ‚ÄôDashboard‚Äô etc. Using Pascal case for components differentiate it from default JSX element tags.

        * Methods/functions defined inside components should be in Camel case like ‚ÄògetApplicationData()‚Äô, ‚ÄòshowText()‚Äô etc.

        * For globally used Constant fields in the application, try to use capital letters only. Like const PI = ‚Äú3.14‚Äù;
    
    3. format my code before committing.
    4. don't use inline-styles.

 2. use media query

 3. Define Typography
    -Generally, web developers define font sizes with pixels. These work on static websites, but responsive websites need a responsive font. Font size must change with respect to parent container width. This is necessary to make typography adjust to screen size and be easily readable on multiple devices.

    In the CSS3 specification, look for the unit named rems. It is similar to the em unit but acts relative to the HTML element. Because of this, the code must reset the HTML font-size .

    @ {font-size:1rem;}
 4. confidence .
```
