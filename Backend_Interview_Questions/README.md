```
### 2. What is load balancing ?
```bash
In computing, load balancing refers to the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources, with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient. Load balancing can optimize the response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle.
```
### 3. What is CAP Theorem ?
```bash
In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that any distributed data store can only provide two of the following three guarantees:[1][2][3]

1. Consistency =>
Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
2. Availability =>
Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
3. Partition tolerance =>
The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.
```
### 4. What is PACELC Theorem ?
```bash
PACELC builds on the CAP theorem. Both theorems describe how distributed databases have limitations and tradeoffs regarding consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. PACELC however goes further and states that an additional trade-off exists: between latency and consistency, even in absence of partitions, thus providing a more complete portrayal of the potential consistency trade-offs for distributed systems.
```
### 5. What is Eventual Consistency ?
```bash
Eventual Consistency is a guarantee that when an update is made in a distributed database, that update will eventually be reflected in all nodes that store the data, resulting in the same response every time the data is queried.
```
### 6. What is Strong Consistency ?
```bash
Strong consistency is one of the consistency models used in the domain of concurrent programming (e.g., in distributed shared memory, distributed transactions). The protocol is said to support strong consistency if: All accesses are seen by all parallel processes (or nodes, processors, etc.)
```
### 7. What are the different types of databases ?
```bash
There are various types of databases used for storing different varieties of data:-

1) Centralized Database
2) Distributed Database
3) Relational Database
4) NoSQL Database
5) Cloud Database
6) Object-oriented Databases
7) Hierarchical Databases
8) Network Databases
9) Personal Database
10) Operational Database
11) Enterprise Database
```
### 8. What are message queues ?
```bash
Message queues allow different parts of a system to communicate and process operations asynchronously. A message queue provides a lightweight buffer which temporarily stores messages, and endpoints that allow software components to connect to the queue in order to send and receive messages.
```
### 9. Which service by Amazon Web Services (AWS) can you use for Queues ?
```bash
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
```
### 10. What is Pub Sub ?
```bash
A pub/sub model allows messages to be broadcasted asynchronously across multiple sections of the applications. The core component that facilitates this functionality is something called a Topic. The publisher will push messages to a Topic, and the Topic will instantly push the message to all the subscribers.
```
